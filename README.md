## How to use the script ?

To use this soft, you have to check that Python env is installed.
If that is the case, install (or check his presence) the Python module : *json*
```console
~$ pip install json
```

If all theses conditions are good for you, launch the python script like this:
```console
~$ python IMH.py
```
